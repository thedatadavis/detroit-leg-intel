### Context
Outlier Media is developing *Detroit Legislative Intelligence* (DLI), a searchable database of public meetings and resolutions. To sustain this tool, we intend to sell "Professional" subscriptions (alerts, exports, API access) to high-volume users such as law firms and developers, while keeping the search tool free for residents.

This document outlines the operational guardrails ensuring this product supports—and never undermines—our editorial mission.

### Core Principle: Monetizing Efficiency, Not Access
We monetize **convenience**, not the **public record**.
*   **The Public (Civic Tier):** Has access to 100% of the public record. No public document, resolution, or vote will be hidden behind a paywall.
*   **The Customer (Pro Tier):** Pays for *efficiency*. They pay for automated email alerts, bulk CSV exports, and API access because it saves them labor hours.
*   **Policy:** We will never sell exclusive access to information. If it is in the database, a resident can find it for free.

### Policy 1: Editorial Independence
**1. Subscribers are Customers, Not Sources.**
Buying a subscription to DLI grants access to the software only. It purchases no influence over editorial coverage.
*   **Protocol:** If a subscriber attempts to leverage their subscription to kill a story or influence coverage, the subscription will be immediately terminated and refunded.
*   **Transparency:** We will publish a list of "Enterprise" level subscribers annually in our transparency report.

**2. Accountability Consistency.**
We anticipate using this tool to hold our own subscribers accountable.
*   **Editorial Stance:** If a developer subscribes to the tool, that does not immunize them from investigation. We will use the same database to investigate their activities. The tool is a neutral utility; our reporting remains accountability-focused.

### Policy 2: Internal Usage & Timing
**1. Concurrent Access.**
The Editorial team has administrative access to the live ingestion feed.
*   **Workflow:** If the system detects a high-value anomaly (e.g., a large contract awarded to a known bad actor), the system flags it for the newsroom simultaneously with sending external customer alerts.
*   **Operational Reality:** We accept that by selling automated alerts, a subscriber may see a resolution at the same time a reporter does. We compete on *synthesis and investigation*, not just breaking the news that a document exists.

### Policy 3: Documenter Guidelines
**1. Maintaining Civic Focus.**
We will **not** alter Documenter training or assignment instructions to favor commercial interests.
*   **Guideline:** Documenters will continue to prioritize human sentiment, protest, and community impact in their notes.
*   **Protection:** We will not ask Documenters to track specific commercial data points for clients unless it also serves a journalistic purpose. The AI handling extraction shields Documenters from data-entry tasks.

### Policy 4: Privacy & Data Protection
**1. Protecting Private Citizens.**
While public meetings are public record, DLI aggregates data in ways that could be misused.
*   **Restriction:** We will technically inhibit the ability to "Bulk Export" the names of private citizens who give public comment. We index public officials and vendors for bulk analysis; we do not facilitate the mass surveillance of residents.

### Policy 5: Revenue Allocation
**1. Reinvestment Strategy.**
Revenue generated by DLI is explicitly earmarked for:
1.  Covering the technical costs of the platform (Servers, AI tokens).
2.  Expanding the Documenters Program (Paying more residents to cover more meetings).
3.  General Editorial Operations.

### Discussion Questions for Editorial Team
1.  Are there specific agencies (e.g., Board of Police Commissioners) where automating data collection poses a specific risk to vulnerable sources?
2.  How should we handle the "Related Reporting" integration? Should reporters have a review process for which stories are linked to specific resolutions?
3.  Does the "Civic Tier" (Free Search) sufficiently meet our definition of Information Equity, or are there other barriers to access we need to address?
