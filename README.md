Detroit Legislative Intelligence (DLI) is a product concept designed to aggregate, index, and monitor the legislative history of Detroit’s 15+ governing agencies.

Currently, critical data lives in silos—PDFs on the Housing Commission site, transcripts in Otter.ai, and notes on Documenters.org. DLI unifies this into a single "Google-like" search engine, transforming a cost center into a potential recurring revenue engine.

## Feature Walkthrough (What to Click)

Because this is a concept simulation, it is scripted to demonstrate a specific high-value user flow. Follow these steps to experience the vision:

**1. The "Command Center"**
*   *What to look for:* The **Live Ingestion Feed** on the dashboard. This simulates real-time monitoring of disparate agencies (e.g., DHC, City Council, BZA) in one place.

**2. The Universal Search**
*   *Action:* Click the Search Bar and type **"Security"** (or just hit Enter).
*   *What happens:* The app simulates a search query returning results from multiple agencies. Note how **City Council** contracts (API data) appear next to **Housing Commission** resolutions (PDF data).

**3. The "Rosetta Stone" View**
*   *Action:* Click on the first result: **"Approval of Security Camera... Resolution 3333."**
*   *The Vision:* This screen demonstrates the core value proposition. It displays three distinct layers of data side-by-side:
    *   **Extracted Data:** Vendor name, Dollar Amount, and Vote Status extracted from the PDF.
    *   **Human Context:** The "Yellow Box" showing the Documenter's notes (sentiment/scene-setting).
    *   **Official Record:** The OCR text of the resolution.
