## 1. Executive Summary
Outlier Media currently possesses the most comprehensive record of Detroit’s public meetings through the Documenters program. However, this asset is currently distributed across static notes, unsearchable PDFs, and siloed audio transcripts.

**Detroit Legislative Intelligence (DLI)** is a data platform designed to aggregate, index, and make searchable the legislative history of Detroit’s 15+ agencies.

By combining human-generated context with AI-driven processing, DLI transforms a program operation into a dual-purpose asset: a powerful accountability tool for residents and a recurring revenue engine based on high-value business intelligence.

## 2. The Market Problem: Data Fragmentation
Legislative data in Detroit is fractured, making accountability difficult for residents and expensive for professionals.

*   **The Platform Gap:** While City Council utilizes Municode, powerful quasi-public agencies—such as the Housing Commission, Land Bank, and Board of Zoning Appeals—utilize isolated websites.
*   **The PDF "Black Hole":** Critical spending decisions often reside inside scanned PDF resolutions that are invisible to standard search engines.
*   **The Context Void:** Existing automated tools provide raw text scraping but lack the human context, such as public sentiment, debate nuance, and protest activity, that explains *why* a vote occurred.

**The Economic Cost:**
Stakeholders including real estate developers, law firms, and advocacy groups currently incur significant labor costs to manually monitor meetings and scour documents for risks and opportunities.

## 3. The Solution: A Unified Intelligence Engine
DLI is a unified search and monitoring platform that ingests data from three distinct sources to create a comprehensive view of local government activity.

### The Three Data Layers
1.  **The Official Record:** OCR-processed Resolutions, Contracts, and Agendas scraped directly from agency websites.
2.  **The Verbatim Record:** Full-text searchable transcripts generated from meeting audio.
3.  **The Human Context:** Documenters' notes providing summaries, sentiment analysis, and scene-setting.

### Key Capabilities
*   **Universal Search:** Users can query keywords to see results across Council, Zoning, and Housing commissions instantly.
*   **Entity Extraction:** The system automatically identifies Vendors, Dollar Amounts, and Property Addresses within static PDFs.
*   **Smart Alerts:** Users receive immediate notifications when specific keywords or entities are mentioned in any meeting, transcript, or resolution.

## 4. Strategic Alignment

### Advancing Information Equity
DLI democratizes access to complex government data. Currently, navigating agency resolutions requires insider knowledge. This platform makes critical information accessible to any resident via a simple search interface, ensuring that public spending cannot be obscured in email attachments or scanned documents.

### Driving Organizational Sustainability
This product introduces a scalable Earned Revenue model to the organization. By leveraging assets that are already being created—Documenters notes and audio transcripts—we can optimize our operational spend and reduce dependency on philanthropic funding.

## 5. Business Model
The platform utilizes a cross-subsidization model: professional subscriptions fund free access for the public.

| Tier | Target Audience | Pricing | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Civic** | Residents, Nonprofits, Researchers | **Free** | Search recent history, read-only access to all public documents. |
| **Professional** | Boutique Lobbyists, Developers, Unions | **Subscription** | Unlimited search history, email alerts, PDF downloads, and export capabilities. |
| **Enterprise** | Law Firms, Major Developers, Universities | **License** | API access, bulk data exports, unlimited team alerts, and white-glove onboarding. |

**Market Opportunity:**
The initial target market includes law firms, real estate development groups, and institutional partners who require timely, accurate legislative monitoring. Conservative projections estimate a path to significant Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) within 18 months of launch.

## 7. Operational Requirements

This platform is designed as a low-maintenance software asset rather than a high-overhead operation.

*   **Technology:** Python-based scrapers, PostgreSQL database, and AI-driven processing for entity extraction.
*   **Maintenance:** Routine maintenance managed by Operations, requiring minimal ongoing engineering hours.
*   **Scalability:** Built on cloud infrastructure that scales automatically with data volume, keeping fixed costs low.
*   **Resilience:** Automated monitoring systems to detect and flag changes in source agency websites.
